# Starwars Blog Reading List
<!--endhide-->

*The force is strong with this exercise...*

We are going to be building a minimalist version of the [Star Wars Databank](https://www.starwars.com/databank) with a "Read Later" or "Favorites" list functionality.

### Here is a Demo!

## 🌱 How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react flux boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```text
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp
```

**👉 Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

> 💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## 📝 Instructions

1. Use Bootstrap components, you need **almost** no custom CSS.
2. Take some time to understand the [SWAPI.tech](https://www.swapi.tech/documentation) API, this will be our source of information, we will be consuming this API.
3. Fetch the SWAPI's people, vehicles, and planets to display them on your application.
4. Declare a `favorites` array in your central store and allow the user to add or remove favorites.

### Building the grid

- Create a React webapp that lists the *people*, *vehicles* and *planets* entities provided by the [SWAPI](https://www.swapi.tech/documentation).

> Note: Please use https://www.swapi.tech/ instead of https://swapi.dev/ because the second one is causing problems.

</p>

### Building a "Details" view

- Each entity should have a short description (Bootstrap Card) and a "Details" view (Bootstrap components):

</p>

***Important***: The SWAPI doesn't provide the images, you can use https://starwars-visualguide.com to get the images easily. The focus of this exercise is to practice *fetch*, *router*, and *context*. Also, you can focus on the color theme and a simple layout to make it look good.

***Important 2***: Don't worry if the data you get from the SWAPI doesn't match the data you see in starwars.com.

Use all the information provided by the SWAPI (check the docs and/or the JSON responses).

### Read Later or Favorites functionality

Implement a "Read Later" functionality, i.e., a button that allows the user to "save" the item (character, vehicle or planet) into a special list. The location of this list is your choice, as long as it works correctly (in our demo, it's a button on the navbar); this list resembles the main list but only shows the "saved" elements.

### Use the Context

To ensure that the user can "save" the item, you must implement an action that can be accessible from anywhere within the app.

## 😎 Feeling Confident?

The following features are not needed for the final solution, but you can develop them if you feel confident enough:

- `+1` Prevent the website from fetching the Startwars API again if refreshed (you can use the `localStorage` to save the store on the local browser).
- `+3` Implement a search bar with autocomplete for characters, planets, and vehicles. When the autocomplete is clicked it should take you to the detailed page of the element.
